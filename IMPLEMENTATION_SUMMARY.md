3. **✅ Frontend Structure** 
   - Built comprehensive HTML template (`templates/index.html`)
   - Responsive CSS styling (`static/style.css`)
   - Professional UI with timer circle, controls, and settings

4. **✅ Core Timer Logic**
   - Complete JavaScript implementation (`static/timer.js`)
   - 25-minute work sessions with proper countdown
   - 5-minute short breaks and 15-minute long breaks
   - Session state management (work → break → work cycle)

5. **✅ User Interface Interactions**
   - Start/Pause/Reset/Skip functionality
   - Settings panel with customizable durations
   - Visual progress indicators with session dots
   - Real-time UI updates during countdown

6. **✅ Backend Integration & Logging**
   - AJAX communication with Flask backend
   - Session logging to `pomodoro_log.txt`
   - Timestamps and detailed session tracking
   - Browser notifications for session completion

### 🧪 **Testing & Validation**
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_app.py`)
- Verified all API endpoints work correctly
- Confirmed session logging functionality
- Browser testing shows proper UI behavior
